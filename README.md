Function to Generate Password: This function generates a password based on the desired length provided as input and randomises everything



# Random Password Generator

This is a simple C++ program that generates random passwords of variable length. Users can specify the desired length of the password, and the program will generate a random sequence of characters within that length range.

## Features

- Generates random passwords consisting of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and special characters.
- Allows the user to specify the length of the password (between 4 and 20 characters).
- Ensures randomness by seeding the random number generator based on the current time.
- Provides error handling for invalid input lengths.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `password_generator.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the desired length of the password.
5. The program will generate and display the random password.
